Pacman Algorithms (AI Project)

This project demonstrates the application of artificial intelligence algorithms in the classic Pacman game, where Pacman navigates through a maze, collects items, and avoids ghosts. The project implements various AI techniques to control Pacman’s movement and decision-making processes. Key features include:

Pathfinding Algorithms: Implements algorithms like *A (A-star)**, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the optimal path for Pacman to collect items while avoiding ghosts.
Ghost AI: Simulates the behavior of ghosts using minimax or Q-learning algorithms to create intelligent, dynamic ghost movement based on Pacman’s position and strategy.
Pacman Decision-Making: Uses heuristic-based or decision-tree algorithms to decide when Pacman should eat, run, or change direction to maximize score and minimize risk.
Maze Representation: The game maze is represented as a graph or grid, allowing AI algorithms to efficiently navigate and plan routes.
Random and Strategic Ghost Behavior: Ghosts follow both random and strategic behavior patterns, where they can adapt to Pacman’s movements using AI models.
